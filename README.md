# Dog-Breed-Classification
This project trains and tests an EfficientNet-B3 model to classify 120 dog breeds. It fine-tunes a pretrained model on the Stanford Dogs dataset with data augmentation, saving the best model. The test script loads this model, pre-processes an input image, and predicts the dog breed using folder names as labels
